# ThermVision: Exploring FLUX for Synthesizing Hyper-Realistic Thermal Face Data and Animations via Image to Video Translation

![Thermal Banner](Images/Thermal.gif)

**ThermVision** is a synthetically curated thermal imaging dataset designed to support research in facial analysis under infrared modalities. Unlike conventional thermal datasets captured through physical sensors, ThermVision leverages **FLUX diffusion models**‚Äîa class of high-fidelity generative architectures‚Äîto simulate photo-realistic thermal facial animations under controlled variations in head pose and facial expression.

The dataset is generated using a two-stage process:

1. **Thermal Domain Synthesis with FLUX Diffusion**  
   The core of this pipeline involves fine-tuning in the thermal domain using a FLUX diffusion model trained on various subsets of real-world thermal face mappings. This results in high-resolution synthetic thermal sequences that preserve realistic temperature gradients, structural fidelity, and dynamic consistency across frames.

2. **Video Retargeting Pipeline**  
   Clean visible-spectrum facial videos of male and female subjects are processed using a retargeting framework to extract motion dynamics including pose shifts, gaze changes, and facial expressions (e.g., smile, frown, surprise).

Each sample in ThermVision consists of:
- A sequence of synthetic thermal frames depicting continuous head movement or expression changes
- Corresponding pose and expression annotations
- Subject metadata (gender label, synthetic ID)

The dataset includes balanced representations of both male and female synthetic subjects, ensuring coverage across gender, expression types (neutral, smiling, surprised, etc.), and yaw/pitch/roll head rotations.

### üß† Applications Supported
- Thermal face detection and tracking  
- Infrared expression recognition  
- Facial animation learning in low-light or occluded scenarios

By eliminating the need for costly thermal video capture while retaining realism and controllability, **ThermVision** enables scalable and reproducible research in thermal vision, particularly useful for surveillance, defense, health diagnostics, and privacy-preserving facial analytics.

**Datasets**: Tufts, CARL, SF-TL54, Charlotte-ThermalFace  
**Models**: MobileNet_v2, EfficientNet_b0, ResNet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bad Sample Results

While the majority of our generated images are structurally sound and realistic, failure cases still occur due to limitations in retargeted motion or extreme pose variations:

| Failure Sample | Issue |
|----------------|-------|
| ![Failure 1](Fail-Cases/11.png) | Thermal noise hallucination, unrealistic temperature map |
| ![Failure 2](Fail-Cases/13.png) | Loss of facial structure under extreme yaw |

We are actively refining the synthesis stage and improving retargeting stability to minimize these issues.
